1) First I started with File setup, created a "Portfolio" folder on my desktob and created a new index and css file on Visual Studio Code.

2) My main mission was to create and fix my layout in HTML, there for I decided all the elements location's  and figured out what kind of portfoliio i'dd like to see.
I understand that there was supposed to be Home, About and contact me. I switched things a little bit around. Firt we will see our home page anyway but to use this better in the future I added projects section instead.
